A simple tool for downloading CMIP5 data from the [CEDA](http://www.ceda.ac.uk/) mirror. You'll need to have your own access credentials for the [BADC](https://badc.nerc.ac.uk/home/), but the convenience methods in `CEDA_download.py` should make it easy to download combinations of data, even when you have a generic search criterion. Included are sample scripts, `get_\*.py`, which illustrate how to script the downloading using this tool.
